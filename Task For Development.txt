There are several features that I want to add to the application update later :

1. Add icon to copy,voice,and clear button
2. Add threading or multiprocessing features so that when translating text it doesn't freeze the GUI
3. Add window icon
4. Convert kivy to apk so it can play in android
5. Disable or hide console when running the application (Exe file)

if anyone wants to help please teach me about how to solve the problem above
